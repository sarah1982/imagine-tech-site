            <p class="hero-text">  Simply put, the quality of your marketing determines a huge portion of your online success. Even more important than a well-developed website, is a solid marketing strategy. Our marketing team does the research to help you determine how to reach a greater number of potential clients. For example, our team can tell you that the word “services” which you planned on adding to your super cool website only has a search volume of 400 searches per month, but the word “service” has 2,400 searches per month. That’s literally a 
                two thousand potential client difference! In just one letter! Now imagine the difference in over 100 well placed keywords, all throughout your website.</p>
